# Flutter Tindeq Progressor Climbing Strength Tester

A Flutter application to run climbing strength tests that can store and visualise results. This project is very much in the development stage and is definitely not working - only the initial UI and independent Bluetooth package have been developed. I have a long way to go.

The screenshots are using dummy data generated from my Python version of this application.

I have forked QuickBlue and got that running with the Tindeq Progressor so now I need to integrate the two.

My next steps for this project are:
- [ ] Move Quickblue into the Tindeq folder
- [ ] Integrate Quickblue as a Riverpod Stream
- [ ] Add Isar to store user results
- [ ] Add an analysis screen to review user data
- [ ] Add trending analysis of individual user data
- [ ] Add analysis of all user data and correlate against actual climbing grades

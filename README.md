# Flutter Tindeq Progressor Climbing Strength Tester

A Flutter application to run climbing strength tests that can store and visualise results.

The application is currently in development and so far only the initial UI has been developed. I'm using dummy data generated from my Python version of this application.

I have forked QuickBlue and got that running with the Tindeq Progressor so now I need to integrate the two.

My next steps for this project are:
- [ ] Move Quickblue into the Tindeq folder
- [ ] Integrate Quickblue as a Riverpod Stream
- [ ] Add Isar to store user results
- [ ] Add an analysis screen to review user data
- [ ] Add trending analysis of individual user data
- [ ] Add analysis of all user data and correlate against actual climbing grades
